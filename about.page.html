                <h2 class="article-title">My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2>
                <p class="article-body"> 
                    I find life better, and I'm happier, when things are nice and simple.
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I loved,
                     but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                    and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article-post-title">How I turned things around</h2>
                <p class="article-body">
                    I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. 
                    I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved 
                    into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
             
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, 
                    I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article-post-title">Now I live the simple life</h2>
                <p class="article-body">
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, 
                    things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, 
                    and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="article-body">
                    With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice
                     but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a 
                     simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
